Your task is to create two threads
you should make one thread sub-class the java.lang.Thread Class
The other should be created using runnable, which you can pass to the Thread constructor.
This can be any class that implements Runnable interface or lambda expression.


Each thread should be have run method. The first thread's code should print 5 even numbers and the second thread
print 5 odd numbers.

You should execute them asynchronously, calling the start method on each,
in two consecutive statements, in your main code.

Have your main method, after these threads run few seconds, and interrupt one or both of these threads.
